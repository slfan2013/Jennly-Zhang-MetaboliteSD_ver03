"Raw_Phenotype_UCDavis"  include all phenotypes

"Phenotype_UCDavisSelect" include only 87 phenotypes

"Null_Metabolomics" have 20 male wildtype & 20 female wildtype

"Metabolites Data_KO versus Null & with gender" include all genotype & wild type mice

"Body composition" shows what phenotype should be adjusted, here we adjust the body weight


Outline:
1. Null(wildtype)mice: 20male+20 female
1a. Sexual Dimorphism(SD) analysis of metabolomics without adjusting by body weight
1b. Sexual Dimorphism(SD) analysis of metabolomics with adjusting by body weight
1c.(not do) top 10 metabolites enriched in female and male, do bar charts in each genotype (will be done latest)

2. for all mice
2a. Metabolite~genotype+sex+genotype*sex+weight

3. SD in correlation between metabolomics & phenotype (heatmap? do later)
